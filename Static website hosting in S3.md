#  React App Static Website Hosting in AWS with Cloudfront distribution

##  Why hosting static website in S3.

Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features so onecan organize the data and configure finely-tuned 
access controls to meet the desired business needs. Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9’s) of durability and
99.99%(4 9's) availability over a given year

Among other reasons the top two are...

Easy set-up : Deploying static files requires a lot less moving parts than an app with a server. There’s less to set up and less to maintain.

Cost- optimized:  Because there’s less to set up and maintain, the cost of deploying a static application can be dramatically cheaper.
